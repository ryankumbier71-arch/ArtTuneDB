</p>

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 (x64 only -- ARM64 not supported)
- PowerShell 5.1 or later (included with Windows)
- Administrator privileges (required for audio driver and registry operations)
- Internet connection (for downloading audio tools during installation)

## Install Script

Run the installer **first**, before downloading the library. Open an **elevated** (Run as Administrator) PowerShell window and run:

```powershell
irm artiswar.io/tools/ArtTuneGuided | iex
```

Or run locally:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File Install-ArtTune.ps1
```

The script presents three options:

1. **Voicemeeter Setup** - For USB headphones, DACs, amps, or onboard audio. Installs Hi-Fi Cable, Voicemeeter, ReaPlugs, renames audio endpoints ("Art Tune", "Normal Audio", "Virtual Mix"), Equalizer APO, HeSuVi, EAC_Default.wav HRIR, and LEQ Control Panel. Offers a Fresh Start mode (uninstalls existing audio tools first) or Advanced mode (keeps what's already installed).
2. **Art Tune Approved Device** - Streamlined install for Sound Blaster devices (GC7, G8). Installs ReaPlugs, Equalizer APO, HeSuVi, EAC_Default.wav HRIR, optional Creative App, and LEQ Control Panel. Offers a Fresh Start mode (uninstalls existing E-APO first) or Advanced mode.
3. **Uninstall everything** - Removes all installed components with optional LEQ Control Panel removal. Prompts for system restart.

Desktop shortcut created automatically:

- **ArtTuneDB** - ArtTuneDB folder (contains all tool shortcuts, library, and configuration files)

The script does **not** configure E-APO, Voicemeeter routing, LEQ, or profiles. That is done manually (video guide).

## Library Download

After running the installer, download the latest library release from the [Releases](https://github.com/ArtIsWar/ArtTuneDB/releases) page.

### Release Naming

Releases use CalVer with a game tag. They are tied to game seasons, not semver milestones.

**Format:** `YYYY.MM-GameSeason`

**Examples:**

- `2026.02-BO7-S0` - Launch release with BO7 Season 0 configs
- `2026.04-BO7-S2.5` - Season 2.5 update
- `2026.04-BF6-S2` - BF6 Season 2 additions
- `2026.06-Multi` - Multiple game updates in one release

GitHub's auto-generated source ZIP extracts to `ArtTuneDB-2026.02-BO7-S0/` with everything inside, flat, no nesting.

Inside the extracted folder you'll find a `library/` folder. Copy it into the ArtTuneDB folder and overwrite when prompted. The easiest way is to drag the `library/` folder onto the **ArtTuneDB** desktop shortcut (created by the installer).

After each new library release, repeat this step: drag the `library/` folder onto the ArtTuneDB shortcut or copy the updated `library/` folder into ArtTuneDB and overwrite all files.

### ArtTuneDB Folder

The installer creates the following in the ArtTuneDB root:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ArtIsWar.url` | Opens artiswar.io |
| `ArtTuneDB.url` | Opens the ArtTuneDB GitHub for library downloads and the PowerShell script |
| `E-APO Configuration Editor.lnk` | Opens Equalizer APO Configuration Editor |
| `LEQ Control Panel.lnk` | Launches LEQ Control Panel |
| `README.txt` | Quick reference for the folder contents |
| `library\` | Game EQ profiles and presets -- extract library releases here |

### Library Structure

The library is organized by game, then by season:

```

    └── Brand Model.txt                # Headphone frequency response (squig.link format)
```

Each Game/Season folder contains:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `*.lnk` | HeSuVi preset shortcut. Launch to load the matching HeSuVi profile. |
| `*_pre.txt` | Pre-HeSuVi processing chain (7.1 channel). Loaded before HeSuVi in config.txt. |
| `*_post.txt` | Post-HeSuVi processing chain (stereo shaping). Loaded at the end of config.txt. |
| `*_Target_*.txt` | Target curve file. Upload to squig.link to generate headphone-specific EQ. |
| `GadgetryTech SquigLink.url` | Opens [gadgetrytech.squig.link](https://gadgetrytech.squig.link) for headphone EQ generation. |
| `LEQ - Release Time *.txt` | A note indicating the recommended LEQ release time value for this config. |
| `eq/` | Folder for headphone EQ files. Save your squig.link Auto EQ results here. |
| `eq/TargetOnly_*.txt` | Fallback EQ that applies the target without headphone-specific correction. |

The `measurements/` folder contains frequency response data for headphones not widely available on squig.link. Upload these alongside a target curve to generate headphone-specific EQ for unlisted models.

### HRIR Files

The `hrir/` folder in this repo contains the EAC_Default.wav HRIR in two sample rates:

| File | Sample Rate |
|------|-------------|
| `hrir/EAC_Default.wav` | 48 kHz |
| `hrir/44/EAC_Default.wav` | 44.1 kHz | (missing from the OG Verdansk guide, sorry :( )

These are automatically downloaded by the install script. If adding them manually, copy the `hrir/` folder contents into `C:\Program Files\EqualizerAPO\config\HeSuVi\hrir\`.

## JSFX Plugins

Two custom audio processing plugins are included in the `jsfx/` folder:

- **ATK Spatial Engine** (`atk_spatial_engine.jsfx`) -- processes raw 7.1 game audio before HeSuVi. Separates footsteps from gunfire and ambient noise across all surround channels, suppresses your own sounds (gun, reload, movement), and adapts processing intensity based on what's happening in the scene. 59 parameters.
- **ATK Stereo Spatial Enhancer** (`atk_stereo_spatial_enhancer.jsfx`) -- processes stereo headphone output after HeSuVi. Tightens the spatial image by cleaning up crossfeed bleed from HRIR convolution, keeps bass centered, and widens the stereo field for sharper directional cues. 7 parameters.

The BO7 S3 configs require these plugins to function. They are installed to `C:\Program Files\VSTPlugins\ReaPlugs\JS\Effects\ArtTuneKit\`.

- **New installs:** plugins are included automatically when you run the install script.
- **Existing users:** run the install script again and choose `[j] Install JSFX plugins only` from the main menu.

## Tune Variations

BO7 S3 ships with four pre-HeSuVi config variations. Each uses the same Spatial Engine and Stereo Enhancer but with different parameter tuning:

| Variation | File | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Competitive** (default) | `BO7_S3_pre.txt` | Aggressive suppression, heavy noise removal, maximum footstep separation. |
| **Clean** | `BO7_S3_pre_clean.txt` | Lighter processing, more natural spatial image, less artificial boost. |
| **Streamer** | `BO7_S3_pre_streamer.txt` | Gun stays punchy, environment has presence, entertaining mix for content. |
| **Ultra** (experimental) | `BO7_S3_pre_ultra.txt` | Maximum footstep extraction, everything cranked. Sounds processed but every step pops. |

**Manual users:** swap the pre file path in your `config.txt` to change variation.

**App users:** select the variation from the status bar or right-click a profile.

## Configuration

### Pre and Post HeSuVi Files

Each Game/Season folder contains `_pre.txt` and `_post.txt` files:

- **Pre files** handle 7.1 channel processing, applied before HeSuVi convolution.
- **Post files** handle stereo processing and shaping (compression, EQ, limiting), applied after HeSuVi.

Both must be loaded into `config.txt` using the E-APO Configuration Editor:

- Pre file goes **before** the HeSuVi include
- Post file goes at the **very end**

Every game and season should have its matching pre and post files loaded in `config.txt`, even if the files are empty. This keeps your configuration consistent and makes switching between profiles straightforward.

### config.txt

The installer writes a starter `config.txt` (located at `C:\Program Files\EqualizerAPO\config\config.txt`) with placeholder Include lines pointing to `ArtTuneDB\library\`. Browse into the library and replace each path with the real pre, EQ, and post files for your game and season. For example:

```
# PRE HESUVI
Include: ArtTuneDB\library\BO7\S3\BO7_S3_pre.txt
# DO NOT REMOVE HESUVI #
Include: HeSuVi\hesuvi.txt
Include: ArtTuneDB\library\BO7\S3\eq\YourHeadphone_BO7_S3.txt
# POST HESUVI
Include: ArtTuneDB\library\BO7\S3\BO7_S3_post.txt
```

The order matters -- pre, HeSuVi, EQ, post. Do not remove the HeSuVi comment or include line.

### HeSuVi Preset

The matching HeSuVi preset can be launched from the `.lnk` shortcut in the corresponding Game/Season folder.

### Headphone EQ

To generate an EQ profile matched to your specific headphone:

1. Open the `GadgetryTech SquigLink.url` shortcut in the Game/Season folder
2. Upload the target file (e.g., `BF6_Target_S0.txt`) in the **EQ** tab on the left
3. Search for your headset or IEM
   - If your headphone isn't listed on squig.link, check the `measurements/` folder or use the `TargetOnly_*.txt` directly in the EQ field of the config file with the file in the `eq/` folder, as a last resort. This applies the target curve without headphone-specific correction -- it's better than no EQ, but won't be as accurate as a matched profile.
4. Hit **Auto EQ**
5. Save the result as `YourHeadphone_BO7_S0.txt` (matching the game and season you're tuning for)
6. Place the file in the `eq/` subfolder inside the Game/Season folder

### LEQ Release Time

Each Game/Season folder contains a file like `LEQ - Release Time 2 (Insta).txt` that indicates the recommended LEQ release time value for that configuration. Set the LEQ state and Release Time on the Art Tune device using [LEQ Control Panel](https://github.com/ArtIsWar/LEQControlPanel).

### In-Game Settings

Each game has required in-game audio settings for the processing chain to work correctly. Reference files are in the library root:

| File | Covers |
|------|--------|
| `library/BF6_SETTINGS.md` | Battlefield 6 -- Volume Mixer routing, 7.1 Surround, volume levels, audio mix |
| `library/COD_SETTINGS.md` | Black Ops 7, Black Ops 6, Warzone -- device selection, 7.1 Surround, Enhanced Headphone Mode off |

Open the matching settings file for your game and apply the listed values before playing. Incorrect in-game settings (wrong output device, stereo instead of 7.1, Enhanced Headphone Mode on) will bypass or break the processing chain.
